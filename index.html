            <h3> Taj Mahal</h3>
            <p> The most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which 
                is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical "drum" it sits on, which is approximately
                 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud (guava dome).

            <h3> Charminar</h3>
            <p> The construction began in 1589 and was completed in two years with a cost of Rs. 9 lakhs, which was around 2 lakh huns/gold coins 
                in those times. It is said to weigh around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of 30 feet deep foundation. In 1670, a minaret had fallen down 
                after being struck by lighting. It was then repaired at a cost of around Rs. 58000.

            <h3> Hampi</h3>
            <p> The synonym Hampi—traditionally known as Pampa-kshetra, Kishkindha-kshetra or Bhaskara-kshetra—is derived from Pampa, another name of 
                the goddess Parvati in Hindu theology. According to mythology, the maiden Parvati (who is a reincarnation of Shiva's previous wife, Sati) 
                resolves to marry the loner ascetic Shiva
